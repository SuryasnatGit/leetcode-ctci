# Leetcode-CTCI

A collection of programming and algorithmic problems I have worked on during my preparation for technical interviews as well as improving my problem solving skills.

Most of the problems are from Leetcode, an online judge I've used to practice, as well as some from Cracking the Coding Interview and various other sources.

I try to come up with optimal solutions that are also elegant code. A large part of my learning process to find the most optimal way of solving a problem is through the online discussion forums, which I collect the best or multiple ways to solve a problem here.

Note the commit dates are not actual dates I've worked on the problem, just never got around to starting a repo for it.
